#Exceptions and Pickling
*J. Brecht, 8/18/2020*

##Introduction
So we’ve been asked to talk about, and write code for, pickling and exception handling. To keep the code on familiar ground, I’ll be working with the To Do List program from the module 6 assignment. That way the new techniques can be directly compared to the old.
I’ll start with the most recognizable one first: exception handling.
What is an exception and why do we want to handle it?
